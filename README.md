   ### User Stories
   Order | Title | Opening Sentence | Estimated Story Points | Details/Story | Acceptance Criteria (what you want this feature to accomplish) | Rationale for Order
   --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- | ---
  1 | Share information about the Artemis mission on social media | As a masters student I want to a way to share my passion about the Artemis mission with my friends and family through instagram. | 3 | I am struggling to share my passion about the Artemis mission with my friends and family. I am a constant user of social media, and I connect with most everyone through those social channels. I want a way to share information on this mission through instagram. | We agree it will be complete when<br/>1. The masters student can access a filter about the Artemis mission.<br/>2. The filter can be used in Instagram.<br/>3. When using the filter, it shows the student's face on the mission.<br/>4. The captured image displays text about one random fact on the mission in English.<br/>5. There are five random and non repeated facts in the Fact Pool. | We interviewed our primary stakeholder and he told us that an Instagram filter is what he thinks will attract attention from his friends.
  2 | Access a  Platform in which to learn about new interstellar discoveries happening everyday | As a parent, I want it to be easy for my child to stay up to date information about NASA missions, and discoveries. | 5 | As a parent of an inquisitive child, I am having trouble teaching him about space.  I know there is a lot of information on current outspace findings, missions, and resources, but I cannot seem to find this information in one place.  It is a lot of work for me to keep my child interested, and engaged, when it is taking me hours to compile the information that I want to share with him. I would love to have a mobile app, like I do for everything else, that would help me share this information with him. | We agree it will be complete when:<br/>1. The parent can access a mobile app that provides a few data points on the artemis mission<br/>2. The app is functional in the App Simulator | Our stakeholder wants to use the app regarless of her locations and she suggests having an mobile application would be really convenient for her child to use
  3 | Centralized space information | As an educational outreach & stem program facilitator, I want a way to access current space events to share across classroms. | 3 | As a facilitor of education, I cannot find an iteractive experience, or wealth of information on current space events.  I am responsible for ensuring that teachers, schools, and stem programs can incorporate accurate, and real time access to intestellar information, but nothing currently exists. | We agree it will be complete when:<br/>1. There is a homepage that serves as the portal towards the AR world.<br/>2. There are buttons for the user to enter the AR portal(s.)<br/>3. There is a button for the user to return to homepage if wanted.<br/>4. There is a button for the user to switch from the app to the filter and vice versa. | Our stakeholder also suggests a homepage to access the AR world easily.
