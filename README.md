   ### User Stories
   Order | Title | Opening Sentence | Estimated Story Points | Details / Story | Acceptance Criteria(what you want this feature to accomplish) | Rationale for Order
   --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- | ---
  1 | Share information about the Artemis mission on social media | As a masters student I want to a way to share my passion about the Artemis mission with my friends and family through instagram. | 3 | I am struggling to share my passion about the Artemis mission with my friends and family. I am a constant user of social media, and I connect with most everyone through those social channels. I want a way to share information on this mission through instagram. | We agree it will be complete when<br/>1. The masters student can access a filter about the Artemis mission.<br/>2. The filter can be used in Instagram.<br/>3. When using the filter, it shows the student's face on the mission.<br/>4. The captured image displays text about one random fact on the mission in English.<br/>5. There are five random and non repeated facts in the Fact Pool. | We interviewed our primary stakeholder and he told us that an Instagram filter is what he thinks will attract attention from his friends.
  2 | Access a  Platform in which to learn about new interstellar discoveries happening everyday | As a parent, I want it to be easy for my child to stay up to date information about NASA missions, and discoveries. | 5 | As a parent of an inquisitive child, I am having trouble teaching him about space.  I know there is a lot of information on current outspace findings, missions, and resources, but I cannot seem to find this information in one place.  It is a lot of work for me to keep my child interested, and engaged, when it is taking me hours to compile the information that I want to share with him. I would love to have a mobile app, like I do for everything else, that would help me share this information with him. | We agree it will be complete when:<br/>1. The parent can access a mobile app that provides a few data points on the artemis mission<br/>2. The app is functional in the App Simulator | Our stakeholder wants to use the app regarless of her locations and she suggests having an mobile application would be really convenient for her child to use
  3 | Centralized space information | As an educational outreach & stem program facilitator, I want a way to access current space events to share across classroms. | 3 | As a facilitor of education, I cannot find an iteractive experience, or wealth of information on current space events.  I am responsible for ensuring that teachers, schools, and stem programs can incorporate accurate, and real time access to intestellar information, but nothing currently exists. | We agree it will be complete when:<br/>1. There is a homepage that serves as the portal towards the AR world.<br/>2. There are buttons for the user to enter the AR portal(s.)<br/>3. There is a button for the user to return to homepage if wanted.<br/>4. There is a button for the user to switch from the app to the filter and vice versa. | Our stakeholder also suggests a homepage to access the AR world easily.
 4 | Explore space onboard the hubble telescope. | As an active student on facebook, I want to explore hubble telescope findings with friends and family | 3 | As a masters student, entrenched in my studies on the hubble telescope, I am unable to find unique experiences related to this topic.  I also want to share these things with my friends, and I feel tremendous responsibility to get the word out about new discoveries. There are not many tools out there that provide interactive experiences around space. | We argee it will complete when:<br/>1. There is at least one more additional initial filter about the Hubble telescope.<br/>2. The additional filter can be used in Instagram.<br/>3. The additional filter has the same features as the first one.<br/>4. Users can shuffle between different filter types. | Our stakeholder wants to have different filters with diverse facts of the Hubble telescope
5 | Use AR worlds to bring instellar discoveries to life | As a mother there is no way to expose my child to current intestellar discoveries in a way that excites, and educates. | 13 | As a mother of many boys, I can't seem to find a way to bring outspace closer to them.  For example, I can't find a way to share with them interesting space objects.  I want it to be visually stimulating, accessible, fun and enjoyable. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is an AR world.<br/>2. The AR world renders when the user changes viewpoints.<br/>3. There are spcaebodies in the AR world.<br/>4. When a spacebody is clicked on, facts about that spacebody will be displayed.<br/>5. There are unique facts in addition to the displayed information. | Our stakeholder is interested in using the AR technology due to its interactive and informative format.
6 | Continually engage with more AR worlds to explore | As a student studying unmanned systems in space I want to explore more AR worlds | 20 | As a student studying unmanned systems in space, I am looking to get even closer to the world I study.  Once I close my textbooks, I struggle to find a captivating way to continually feed my desire to experience all the discoveries made by NASA.  Studying textbooks is one thing, but I want to experience what I'm studying, and bring it to life. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is an additional AR world.<br/>2. The additional AR world is seperated to the first AR world.<br/>3. The additional AR world has the same features as the first AR world.<br/>4. The additional AR world has different space topic to the first AR world. | The stakeholder expected to have a different AR world that brings distinct experience and information. Thus, he can learn more from using the app.
7 | An unified experience regarless of device formats | As a mom constantly managing different devices used by my child, I want my child to easily access & learn about outer space | 3 | As a mother, I am constantly managing all the devices that my children use to access entertainment and education.  This creates a world of trouble when an application that my child loves is not available from one device to another. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. The app adjusts properly when moving between devices of different common sceen sizes.<br/>2. The app remains consistent when switching between screen dimentions, between portraint and landscape mode. | Our stakeholder wants to use the app regarless of what devices she has. She doesn't want to be limited in only one type of device.
8 | Maintaining the curiousity of users regarding space knowledge | As a mom, I want my child to be exposed to new facts about space so his interest in space is continually engaged. | 5 | As a mother of three children, attention span is a big problem in my house.  Pile on top of that trying to keep my kids focused, and engaged, a topic is even more challening.  It becomes my responsibility to keep them excited and learning something new which creates a lot of work for me.  I would love to be able to push facts of the day to my children to help with this. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is a push notification "Fact-of-the-day."<br/>2. The notification displays space fact every 24 hours.<br/>3. The fact is up-to-date and non repeated.<br/>4. User can opt out if wanted. | Our stakeholder suggests knowing an unique fact everyday is a good way to remind her to use the app often.
9 | An easy tool to look up information about space | As a mom, I want to have an easy way to look up information. | 8 | There is a lot of content that is cumbersome, and unusable, on other applications that I use, and I really need a way to easily search the application for the information that I am looking for.  I want to make sure that I can help answer questions that my child might have, and they can search through the information they are looking for. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is a search button to look up all information in the app.<br/>2. The information is from the app database.<br/>3. There are keywords and key phrases relevant to user's searching needs. | Our stakeholder wants to confirm his space knowledge  or find the answers quickly, without manually flipping through pages.
10 | Users can provide feedback to the developers directly | As a student, I want to share feedback so that it improves my experience. | 3 | I a student totally engaged in the interstellar world, I have no outlet in which to share ideas and ways to bring outspace to life.  Allowing me to share this feedback will provide a way for me to collaborate with this tool to improve my experience, and maybe the experience of others. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is a testimonial section.<br/>2. User can rate the app via the section.<br/>3. User can share opinion about the app via the section.<br/>4. User can receive confirmation notice that the feedback has recorded. | Our stakeholder wants to share his thoughts and be heard when using the app as part of his contributions in the future's development of this interesting tool.
11 | Users learn about how the app works | As a mom, I want to be able to easily understand how this app works so that I can ensure my child yields the most value. | 2 | AR is forieng to me, but a technology that I want to share with my children.  However, I am scared that it will be over my head.  I want to have a way to best understand how to navigate and draw value from resources within our AR interface so that my children will enjoy it also. | We agree it will complete when:<br/>1. There is a Frequently Asked Question page.<br/>2. The page has all basic instructions for users to navigate in the app.<br/>3. The page has additional suggestions for users to achieve the maximum learning benefits of the app. | As a new user, our stakeholder wants to navigate easily and have questions answered quickly while using the app. 



## Story Point Estimating session
6/30/2020 - Everyone was involved. Lily presented the story in planningpoker.com and everyone in the dev team votes and came to a consensus on the story points for each story. 
![Story Pointing session](PlanningPokerSession.png)
We made a Sprint Goal, and decided that we work work on Backlog Items 1-3. So therefore we were able to forcast that we could do 11 Story Points for Sprint 1.

## Backlog Item Breakdown, Google Spreadsheet kanban board, & Sprint Burndown Chart
During our Sprint Planning, we were able to breakdown our 3 backlog item into 19 tasks. We assigned to a single team member or to multiple members for mob or pair programming sessions. And we also had a column in our Google Spreadsheet to document the Status of each Individual Tasks and we changed the status from In Progress to Done as we started working on the tasks and completed tasks. This is what we used as our Kanban Board
![Sprint Kanban](Sprint1BacklogTaskBreakdownNKanban.png)
We also had the below burndown chart in Spreadsheets to track how many story points we finished in each day of the Sprint.
